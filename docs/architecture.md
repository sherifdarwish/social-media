# System Architecture

## Overview

The Social Media Agent System follows a distributed, agent-based architecture where autonomous agents collaborate to manage social media presence across multiple platforms. The system is designed with modularity, scalability, and maintainability as core principles.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Agent-Based Design
Each platform is managed by a specialized agent that understands the unique characteristics, audience, and content requirements of that platform. The Team Leader agent coordinates all platform agents and ensures consistent brand messaging.

### 2. Modular Components
The system is built with loosely coupled modules that can be independently developed, tested, and deployed. This allows for easy extension and maintenance.

### 3. Configuration-Driven
All behavior is controlled through configuration files, making the system highly customizable without code changes.

### 4. Asynchronous Processing
Content generation, posting, and analytics collection are handled asynchronously to ensure system responsiveness and scalability.

## System Components

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Coordinate activities across all platform agents
  - Generate weekly performance reports
  - Ensure brand consistency across platforms
  - Monitor system health and performance
  - Handle escalations and exceptions

#### Platform Agents
Each platform agent is specialized for its target platform:

**Facebook Agent**
- Content optimization for Facebook's algorithm
- Management of posts, stories, and events
- Community engagement and response handling
- Facebook-specific analytics collection

**X (Twitter) Agent**
- Real-time content posting and engagement
- Thread creation and management
- Trending topic integration
- Twitter-specific metrics tracking

**Instagram Agent**
- Visual content creation and optimization
- Story and Reel management
- Hashtag strategy implementation
- Instagram analytics and insights

**LinkedIn Agent**
- Professional content formatting
- Business networking automation
- Industry-specific content generation
- B2B engagement metrics

**TikTok Agent**
- Short-form video content creation
- Trend analysis and integration
- Music and effect recommendations
- Youth-oriented content strategies

### Content Generation Layer

#### LLM Integration Module
- **Text Generation**: Integration with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Image Generation**: Support for DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and other image models
- **Content Optimization**: Platform-specific content adaptation
- **A/B Testing**: Automated content variation generation

#### Content Pipeline
1. **Content Planning**: Based on calendar and trending topics
2. **Generation**: Using appropriate LLM for text/image content
3. **Optimization**: Platform-specific formatting and enhancement
4. **Review**: Quality checks and brand compliance
5. **Scheduling**: Optimal timing based on audience analytics
6. **Publishing**: Automated posting with error handling

### Data Layer

#### Metrics Collection
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live performance monitoring
- **Historical Data**: Long-term trend analysis
- **Cross-platform Insights**: Unified view across all platforms
- **Custom KPIs**: Business-specific metric tracking

#### Database Schema
```

    ├── Weekly
    └── Monthly
```

### Configuration Layer

#### Configuration Management
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: Environment-specific overrides
- **Secure Key Storage**: Encrypted API key management
- **Dynamic Updates**: Runtime configuration changes
- **Validation**: Schema-based configuration validation

#### API Key Management
- **Multi-provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Stability AI, etc.
- **Rotation Policies**: Automatic key rotation for security
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API usage and costs
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic provider switching

## Data Flow

### Content Creation Flow
```
1. Team Leader → Schedule Content Creation
2. Platform Agent → Request Content from LLM
3. LLM Service → Generate Content
4. Platform Agent → Optimize for Platform
5. Platform Agent → Schedule/Post Content
6. Metrics Service → Collect Performance Data
7. Team Leader → Aggregate Reports
```

### Coordination Flow
```
1. Team Leader → Broadcast Coordination Message
2. Platform Agents → Report Status
3. Team Leader → Analyze Cross-platform Performance
4. Team Leader → Adjust Strategies
5. Platform Agents → Implement Changes
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Agent Distribution**: Agents can run on separate instances
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute content generation across multiple LLM endpoints
- **Database Sharding**: Partition data by platform or time period

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations for all I/O
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar operations for efficiency
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect platform API limits

## Security Architecture

### API Security
- **Key Encryption**: All API keys encrypted at rest
- **Secure Transmission**: TLS for all external communications
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different operations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all actions

### Data Protection
- **PII Handling**: Minimal collection and secure storage of personal data
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with secure key management
- **Compliance**: GDPR and other privacy regulation compliance

## Monitoring and Observability

### System Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Regular agent health verification
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and network utilization
- **Alert System**: Automated alerts for system issues

### Business Monitoring
- **Content Performance**: Real-time engagement tracking
- **Goal Achievement**: Progress toward business objectives
- **ROI Tracking**: Cost per engagement and conversion metrics
- **Competitive Analysis**: Benchmarking against industry standards
